And then all should be well, | have tested this comprehensively on my own 19.04 VM where the
conversion you are after works flawlessly...

If you wish to change the settings back to the default the following one liner will restore the backup
file created in the run with sed:

sudo mv /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml_bak /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml

How cool is the command line!
